# Introduction

With ongoing developments in Life Scienses puts stress on the area of data analysis and bioinformatics. 


The following should be taken care of: 
- Infrastructure
- Environment (tools & dependencies)
- Data
- Data analysis commands (parameters)

##  1. Infrastructure

The problem of the infrastructure is inherently associated to all the choices that follow thereafter. The obvious choice for someone that lacks time and experience for performing command-line analysis is a GUI data analysis platform. With recent advances on the Galaxy platform and its community, and the development of the Belgium version **[usegalaxy.be](https://usegalaxy.be/)**, this is an obvious choice.  

Due to the the problem of ever increasing big data, computationally intensive processes, and the flexibility of including exotic bioinformatics tools or self-written scripts, you might be interested in doing the bioinformatics data-analysis on your lab's server or cloud environment.
